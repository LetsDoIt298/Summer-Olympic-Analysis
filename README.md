This is an analysis of Summer Olympic Games held in varies countries, from the 1896(first modern Olympics held in Athens) to present time


## How Analysis is performed:-
  - Using Python
  - Using pandas, a library of python
  - Based on some critical questions
  - Data stored in .csv format
             
             
## salient features:-
  - Provides pictorial representation through the medium of bar graph to viewers
  - * Include 2 solutions for most of the questions, which will be helpful for upcoming Data Anylists
  - Uniform figure size of throughout
  - Easy and helpful 

## Point to be noted(to ignoore the confusion):-
   In solution of Q4 we have solved in two ways,
   
       -1st way - we get five names as
                                      PHELPS, Michael         22
                                      LATYNINA, Larisa        18
                                      ANDRIANOV, Nikolay      15
                                      MANGIAROTTI, Edoardo    13
                                      ONO, Takashi            13

       -2nd way - we get five names as
                                     PHELPS, Michael         22
                                     LATYNINA, Larisa        18
                                     ANDRIANOV, Nikolay      15
                                     MANGIAROTTI, Edoardo    13
                                     SHAKHLIN, Boris         13
                                     
    So if we may observe that 'ONO,Takashi' is missing from 2nd way of solution and 'SHAKHLIN,Boris' is missing from 1st way of solution
    
    This happens because,
                         there is a draw betweeen these three
                                                              MANGIAROTTI, Edoardo    13
                                                              SHAKHLIN, Boris         13
                                                              ONO, Takashi            13
